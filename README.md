# GESTURE-LINGUA
This project presents the development of a versatile Tetralingual and Gesture Recognition system, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system translates sign language gestures into readable text in real-time, enabling seamless communication between deaf and mute individuals and non-sign language users.
