# GESTURE-LINGUA
This project presents the development of a versatile Tetralingual and Gesture Recognition system, leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system translates sign language gestures into readable text in real-time, enabling seamless communication between deaf and mute individuals and non-sign language users. Beyond its primary function, the system finds applications in various domains, including language learning, accessibility services, emergency response, tourism, legal proceedings, and public events. Performance evaluation demonstrates the system's accuracy and real-time processing capabilities, making it suitable for practical use in diverse settings.
